# Pegasus

Pegasus is a web app to solve the issue of adequate flight panning on-the-go. It includes the main app, which allows the pilot to trace the desired flight route and get general information about each leg, such as time, fuel burn, etc. It also gets data from the DECEA API to provide weather and airport conditions to the pilot.

The other app includes a form to print out a Computed Air Release Point (CARP) map. The functionality was forked from [this repo](https://github.com/thalestmm/Computed_Air_Release_Point). Access it for more information.
